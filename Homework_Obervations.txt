Observations on the Relationship between Latitude and Weather around the World

Considering the "Temperature in World Cities", it is clear that the highest temperatures are found 
at and below the equator. As you rise up north of the equator, the temperaturr has a steady decrease. 
This is easily explained by the fact that the northern hemisphere is currently experiencing colder weather
winter while the southern hemisphere is currently experiencing warmer weather/summer.

Considering the "Humudity in World Cities", "Wind Speed in World Cities" and "Cloudiness in World Cities" figures, 
it looks apparent that there is a large spread in the % of cloudiness and humidity. This is likely because 
there are other variables that will need to be considered in order to find out the relation between city 
location and humidity and cloudiness. One variable that may need to be considered would be the alitude of a 
city alongside its latitude.

Condiering "Wind Speed in World Cities", there was a generla spread that displayed wind speed as low across
most cities around the globe. While the data for "Humudity in World Cities" demonstrated that most cities tended
to have higher levels of humidity. This could be related to the atitude of the city but sould also be related
to the types of locations humans choose to put down a city. More research would be required to better dissect 
the relationship between wind speed/humidity and city location.

While looking at all this data, it is important to note that all this is a snapshot for the day the API data 
was called. Considering this, we would need to get a lot of data generated for multiple days in order to truly 
understand the relationship between latitude and weather.
